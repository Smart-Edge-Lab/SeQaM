  ## Defining how devices are connected 
  links:
   
    - endpoints: ["client:eth1", "router1:eth1"]   ## Your client is connected to the router1 Ethernet port 1
    - endpoints: ["loadclient:eth1", "router1:eth3"]  ## Loadclient  is connected to the router1 Ethernet port 3

    
    - endpoints: ["router1:eth2", "router2:eth2"]  ## Connection between router 1 and 2
   
    - endpoints: ["server:eth1", "router2:eth1"]  ## Your server is connected to the router2 Ethernet port 1
    - endpoints: ["loadserver:eth1", "router2:eth3"] ## Loadserver is connected to the router2 Ethernet port 3
