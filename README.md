# SeQaM
The Service Quality Manager (SeQaM) is a tool developed to facilitate end-to-end service quality management for edge computing. The platform leverages telemetry for data collection from user equipment devices (UE), edge servers, and network components. This allows the correlation of multi-source information to identify and address the root causes of service quality degradation in edge computing. Furthermore, it allows the implementation of feedback mechanisms that enhance overall service quality in edge computing.

For all the information about SeQaM, please refer to our WIKI.
