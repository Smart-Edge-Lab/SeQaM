The EMULATE project is part of the [8ra](https://www.8ra.com/) ("ORA" = continuum) Edge-Cloud Continuum, to build Europe’s Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services towards digital sovereignty. The central objective of this cooperation is to establish a unified “cloud-edge continuum” that operates independently of any single provider and ensures service quality for users.


In EMULATE, we build concepts and tools for measuring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of edge services. Edge computing has become a widely accepted concept over the last decade, encompassing both public commercial solutions and private customized solutions for specific requirements. However, potential users of applications with real-time quality of service requirements often lack appropriate tools to either assess the suitability of public edge service offerings or to plan, design, and build their customized edge computing solution. Therefore, we have designed a service quality manager (SeQaM) that analyzes existing physical and emulated infrastructures and provides meaningful performance metrics to assess their suitability for time-critical edge applications. 


# SeQaM
The Service Quality Manager (SeQaM) is a tool developed to facilitate end-to-end service quality management for edge computing. The platform leverages telemetry for data collection from user equipment devices (UE), edge servers, and network components. This allows the correlation of multi-source information to identify and address the root causes of service quality degradation in edge computing. Furthermore, it allows the implementation of feedback mechanisms that enhance overall service quality in edge computing.

For all the information about SeQaM, please refer to our WIKI.
