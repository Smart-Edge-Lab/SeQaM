The [EMULATE](https://www.fh-dortmund.de/microsite/smartedgelab/projekte/emulate.php?loc=en) project is part of the [8ra](https://www.8ra.com/) ("ORA" = continuum) Initiative. With more than 120 partners from 12 EU Member States, the 8ra Initiative aims to build Europe’s Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services towards digital sovereignty, establishing a unified “cloud-edge continuum” that operates independently of any single provider.

Edge computing has become a widely accepted concept over the last decade, encompassing both public commercial solutions and private customized solutions for specific requirements. However, potential users of applications with real-time service quality requirements often lack appropriate tools to either assess the suitability of public edge service offerings or to plan, design, and build their customized edge computing solution. 

In EMULATE, we focus on building concepts and tools for measuring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of edge services. Therefore, we have designed a service quality manager (SeQaM) that analyzes existing physical and emulated infrastructures and provides meaningful performance metrics to assess their suitability for time-critical edge applications. 


# SeQaM
The Service Quality Manager (SeQaM) is a tool developed to facilitate end-to-end service quality management for edge computing. The platform leverages telemetry for data collection from user equipment devices (UE), edge servers, and network components. This allows the correlation of multi-source information to identify and address the root causes of service quality degradation in edge computing. Furthermore, it allows the implementation of feedback mechanisms that enhance overall service quality in edge computing.
