# Contributing

SeQaM is continuously evolving. Therefore, there are some things still missing and room for improvement. 
Your contribution to the project is highly appreciated.

## Engaging with SeQaM

We use GitHub to manage pull request reviews.

If you're new to contributing, please see the section below: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute).

Before submitting any changes, create a GitHub issue describing the problem you'd like to solve or the enhancement you want to make. Mention in the issue that you're interested in working on it.

The team will review the issue and decide whether it should proceed as a pull request. If approved, the issue will be assigned to you. If not, the team will provide an explanation in the comments.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Claim an Issue:** Before you start working, claim the issue by commenting on it in GitHub. This helps avoid duplicate efforts by multiple contributors.

2. **Ask Questions:** If anything is unclear, feel free to comment on the issue. A maintainer will respond to clarify.

Labels are defined as follows 

- `New_feature`: Use this label to request to work on a new feature you think would be useful for your and other's work.
- `Bug`: As this is a work in progress, some bugs will appear as you test SeQaM. Please inform them using this label.
- `Enhacement`: Some features are already implemented but can be enhanced with new approaches or extra stuff.
- `Question`: Use this label only to request some assistance.
